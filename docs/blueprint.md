## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark, desaturated violet (#14121A) to create a modern and sophisticated backdrop that allows content to stand out.
- Primary color: Saturated violet (#A663CC) for highlights and key interactive elements, ensuring they grab the user's attention.
- Accent color: Lighter, slightly desaturated lavender (#D0A2F7) for subtle accents and hover effects, complementing the primary color without overpowering it.
- Clean, sans-serif font to ensure excellent readability across all devices. Prioritize a font that offers a variety of weights to create visual hierarchy.
- Use a consistent set of outline icons. Ensure the icons are simple, modern, and align with the violet color scheme when active.
- Responsive design with a clear visual hierarchy, using white space effectively to avoid clutter. Use a grid-based system to maintain consistency.
- Subtle transitions and hover effects on interactive elements (buttons, links) to provide feedback and enhance user engagement without being distracting.
